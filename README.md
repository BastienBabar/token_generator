# Token Generator

A simple example to generate an model's unique and configurable token identifier, using the gem [administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) to manage employees and companies and generate a identifier for both objects on the frontend.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Have ruby 2.2.2+ installed (for Rails 5).
```

## Running the tests

```
rails test
```

Tests contain only unit tests as I am using the gem administrate where everything is already handled on the frontend part.

## Deployment

Admin part is accessible with the path **/admin** (*http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin* in development, for example).

## Built With

* [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) - Simple ruby admin dashboard
* *Rails 5.1.4*
* [Sqlite3](https://github.com/sparklemotion/sqlite3-ruby)
